It is a software or hardware tool that can monitor and capture data and network traffic traveling over a network.
A network sniffer, often known as a packet analyzer
I recently explored an intriguing Python script that allows us to capture and analyze network packets at a low level.
This script utilizes raw sockets to intercept network traffic and then dissects the packets to reveal underlying details such as Ethernet frames, IPv4 packets, and specific protocols like ICMP, TCP, and UDP.
